# Shape Game

- This project is a simple Java application designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles by implementing various shapes and their properties. 
- It allows users to interactively select shapes, input their dimensions, and calculate different attributes like area, perimeter, volume, and surface area depending on whether the shape is two-dimensional or three-dimensional.
- The Shape Project is a Java application aimed at showcasing fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) by implementing a variety of geometric shapes and their respective properties. 
- It serves as an educational tool for understanding inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation within the context of Java programming


## Features

- Interactive Interface: The program provides an interactive interface that prompts users to select a shape and input its dimensions.
- Shape Selection: Users can choose from a range of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) shapes.
- Shape Properties: For each selected shape, the program calculates and displays relevant properties such as area, perimeter, volume, and surface area.
- Error Handling: The application includes error handling to validate user input and ensure the program runs smoothly.
- Object-Oriented Design: The project is structured using object-oriented design principles, with classes representing individual shapes and their behaviors.
## How to Use
- Compile: Compile all Java files using a Java compiler.
- Run: Execute the Driver class to start the application.
- Interact: Follow the on-screen prompts to select a shape and input its dimensions.
- View Results: Once the dimensions are provided, the program calculates and displays the relevant properties of the selected shape.
- Restart: Optionally, restart the program to select and calculate properties for another shape
## Disclaimer

- The Shape Project is primarily intended for educational purposes and may not cover all possible edge cases or be optimized for production use. 
- It serves as a learning resource for understanding OOP concepts in Java programming.
